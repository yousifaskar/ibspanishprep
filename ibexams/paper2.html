          <p>
          The Paper 2 is, by far, one of the most straighforward
          examinations that the IB will throw at you. The reason is that
          even if you didn't know a single ounce of spanish, you could
          minimize the possible range of answers per question simply based
          on the grammar and syntax of the question. In my spanish teacher's words:
          <b>"you don't need to know spanish to pass this exam.""</b> We will further examine
          these small yet crucial details within the following exams.
          <em>Open the 2013 Paper 2 Blank Text and Blank Questions. Take 1.5 hours
            and complete the exam. After completion, open the MyAnswers pdf
          and we will go from there. </em><b>*Note*: This review is not intended to "guarantee" you an A.
            In contrast, it assumes that the reader has no spanish knowledge so that we can purely focus on grammar.
            This will make it easier come exams since you will have more knowledge than what I credit you!</b></p>

                              We start at paragraph one, and look for adjectives. Remembering rules 4 & 5, we can safely assume
                              that paragraph one will have #1's answer.

                              <li><b>Grammar/Limited Spanish Knowledge: </b>The possible answers I found, just according to grammar are: "digital", "dinámico", or "sociales".
                                Just by using grammar and little IB tricks, we were able to disect the three paragraphs into
                                three possible words?
                              </li>
                              <li><b>Context/Spanish Knowledge: </b>Now, we use Spanish knowledge and realize that out of three words, "dinámico"
                              probably means dynamic and thus is most related to active. We write "dinámico" as our answer and done!

                            <p class = "text-muted text-center">Now that we are confident of #1's answer, we can use rule #4 and eradicate all the sentence before "activo" -
                              nearly most of the first paragraph. Now we look for a synonym to "fundamental". Let's see what adjectives we
                              can pull out:
                            </p>

                              <li><b>Grammar/Limited Spanish Knowledge: </b>"sociales", "esencial", "últimos". Now, as rule #5 states, every paragraph will somehow have an answer,
                                so that's why we only consider three options (the little sliver of paragraph 1 and paragraph 2).

                              <li><b>Context/Spanish Knowledge: </b>So, once again, we narrow our options to just three, and using common knowledge, we can guess that "esencial"
                              is most like "fundamental", and thus is our answer.
                              </li>

                            a verb and some phrase. Let's see what we can find!

                                  Now that we've limited our choices to four, we can use cognitives to guess that "conectado a" means
                                  "connected to" and so, we can eliminate choices 1 and 3 (neither of them are close to meaning "connected to").
                                  "han aumentado" is difficult to understand, but now we can use rule #5 and guess that, because we are going to
                                  need to find two more answers, we doubt that the IB would put both those answers within the last lines
                                  of the section. Thus, we choose "visitaron un sitio de redes".

                                  Lots of possibilities, but we can guess that "consumidores" signifies "consumers", and thus eliminates
                                  options 2,4,5,6, and 7.

                                      The question itself removes one of these options -- "agencia" is similar to "oficina"

                                    given by the question that can give us the right answer: "lugares" and "para controlar".
                                  </p>

                                    <li><b>Grammar/Limited Spanish Knowledge: </b>Use rule #3 to ignore any phrase before "docena de hijos".
                                      "Lugares" indicates we need a plural noun, and "para controlar" signifies that there needs to be a
                                      specified purpose to this place. Let's look for options: We have "habitaciones conectadas mediante corredores
                                     de madera" and "balcones que servían para supervisar el trabajo de los recolectores." We can even see
                                     similarity among the second option with "para supervisar" which is not prevalent in the first option.
                                     Thus, our answer is "balcones" (only put "balcones").

                                    in this scenario is ensuring you understand the question. Many students will confuse this question and
                                    thus get it wrong.

                                  <p>Remember that when a question is asked, the verb and subject is switched. Thus, the "¿Qué incorporaron	las	rústicas haciendas"
                                    is not "what incorporated the rústicas haciendas" but rather "what did the rústicas haciendas incorporate...".
                                    Now, with this, we need to look for nouns: We can choose "la rusticidad de la arquitectura" o "elementos que brindan comodidad".
                                    "rusticidad" is very similar to "rústicas" so this probably wasn't an incorporation, so we choose the second answer.

                                         but rather the description. For example, D is a horrible answer as the text barely mentions that topic.
                                         Similarly, it does not only talk about a cafetera colombiana, so the okay answer B is gone.
                                         A and C are harder to distinguish. After looking at description, look at title. Depending on the test,
                                         this could give you the answer. This test does! The title is "la región cafetera de Colombia",
                                         which is exactly what C says. So C is our answer. If the title does not help, go back to descriptions, and choose the
                                         best one (i.e. there is no mention that the author is a tourist nor does it describe the author's OWN experiences, so
                                         A is not the right answer (this is still the good answer)).

                                        version of combinar. Thus, we know that the blank <b>HAS TO</b> include a "que" since we cannot
                                        conjugate after a preposition. Using this, we can eliminate every option besides "es posible que" and
                                        "puesto que". Out of seven options, we've reduced it to two simply because of one grammar rule. But, actually,
                                        we can reduce it even more. "Es posible que" won't make sense since it also includes a conjugated verb before "que".
                                        Thus, the <em>only</em> possible answer is "puesto que", and even I, the writer, don't know what "puesto que" means.

                                      <li><b>Grammar/Limited Spanish Knowledge: </b>Let's trace the sentence. We start off with "este proyecto", a singular
                                         noun. If we continue along the sentence, we see that eventually, after the comma, the verb is "fueron". Somehow,
                                         although we started with a singular noun, we ended with a plural verb. Thus, the blank somehow has to 'add' to the number
                                         on the noun (especially since the sentence does not break into different clauses (which could possibly allow
                                         for this)). No option could possibly do this except "junto con", thus giving us the answer.
